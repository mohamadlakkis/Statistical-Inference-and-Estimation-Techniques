# Statistical Inference and Estimation Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis related to statistical inference and estimation techniques, focusing on confidence intervals, bootstrap methods, UMVUE, exponential families, and MLE analysis. The main topics covered include:

1. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: Estimating the coverage of three types of confidence intervals for the true skewness of a population.
2. **Exact and Monte Carlo Approximation**: Calculating the true skewness using theoretical and Monte Carlo methods.
3. **Confidence Intervals**:
  - **Normal Confidence Interval**
  - **Pivotal Confidence Interval**
  - **Percentile Confidence Interval**
4. **UMVUE, Exponential Families, and MLE Analysis**: Conducted in-depth studies on sufficiency, exponential families, and the Rao-Blackwell theorem, including construction and analysis of UMVUEs, deriving sufficient statistics, and proving the efficiency of estimators under the Cram√©r-Rao bound. Analyzed MLEs for exponential families, proving optimality and constructing transformations to achieve minimal variance estimators. Compared parametric and non-parametric estimators through simulations across different distributions, evaluating their performance in terms of MSE.
